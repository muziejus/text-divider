# Segments from _The Great Gatsby_, by F. Scott Fitzgerald

Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her;
If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,
Till she cry "Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,
I must have you!"

THOMAS PARKE D'INVILLIERS.

<1>Chapter 1

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice
that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.

/Mr. Carraway"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," 

he told me, 

/Mr. Carraway"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the
advantages that you've had."

I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how
a dozen people had sent their love through me.

/Daisy"Do they miss me?"

she cried ecstatically.

/Nick"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel
painted black as a mourning wreath, and there's a persistent wail all night
along the north shore."

/Daisy"How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. To-morrow!" 

<1>Chapter 2

About half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily
joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to
shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. 

/Tom"We're getting off,"

he insisted. 

/Tom"I want you to meet my girl."
